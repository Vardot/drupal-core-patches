## [Unreleased]

- ci: Fix the "Upload the install log" artifact name on PR runs -- `github.ref_name` resolves to `<PR>/merge` on a pull_request run, and the `/` made `actions/upload-artifact@v4` reject the name and fail the job `if: always()` even when every patch applied cleanly (that is what made #58-#61 report red). PR runs now use `pr-<number>`; branch pushes keep the readable `<branch>` name
