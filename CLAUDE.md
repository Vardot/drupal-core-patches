# CLAUDE.md — vardot/drupal-core-patches

Working notes.

- **Purpose**: hold Drupal **core** patches for Varbase, one git branch per Drupal core MAJOR.MINOR.
- **Type**: Composer `metapackage` (no code). Patches declared in `extra.patches."drupal/core"`.
- **Branches**: `11.3.x`, `10.6.x` (core-minor); `patches` (flat `.patch` file store, no composer.json).
- **Binding**: each core-minor branch sets `conflict: {"drupal/core": "<minor.0 || >=next.0"}` so Composer
  selects the release matching the installed core. Consumers require `~10 || ~11 || ~12` (or `~11 || ~12`).
- **Patch files**: stored on the `patches` branch; referenced by raw URL
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vardot/drupal-core-patches/refs/heads/patches/<file>`.
- **Consumed by**: `vardot/varbase-patches` (allowlists this package so its patches apply).
- **Releasing**: tag semver within the minor; **never move a tag** (Packagist fails). See docs/releasing.md.

### Issue / PR titles

Every patch issue and its PRs share ONE title, in this grammar (proper names Capitalized, no trailing period):

`<Action> a patch for the <Target> on <ref>[ -- <reason>]`

- **Action** — `Add` · `Change` · `Remove` · `Update` · `Revert -`. Use `Remove all patches for …` when dropping every patch for a target.
- **Target** — usually `Drupal Core`; occasionally a `<machine> recipe` or a `<vendor/lib> library`.
- **ref** — the upstream change: `fix: #3607821 <summary>` (current commit-type form) or `Issue #3607821: <summary>` (legacy form).
- **reason** (optional) — why now: `-- after Inline Entity Form 3.0.0 was released`.

Rules:

- **A re-roll or a correction of an existing patch is a `Change`** — never `fix: Re-roll…` or any ad-hoc `{type}:` prefix. Keep the upstream type and issue title; the "why now" goes in the `-- <reason>` suffix.
- **A patch change split across branches shares ONE canonical title** — the issue, the `patches`-branch file PR and the version-branch wiring PR all carry the same title.
- **A change ported to several core-minor branches keeps that one title plus a `- for Drupal <x.y.z>` (or `- for Varbase <x.y.x>`) suffix per PR** — never a trailing `(<branch>)` tag, never an ad-hoc `ci: #<n> …` prefix. This holds for infrastructure changes (CI workflows, tests, docs) too.
- **Infrastructure / branch issues drop the "patch for" grammar** and state the action directly, e.g. `Add a no-patches branch - to let developers manage their list of patches in the root composer.json`.
- **The patch file name follows the same source of truth as the title.** A corrected or re-rolled file is a NEW dated file (dated files are immutable), named `<package>--YYYY-MM-DD--<issue>--mr-<n>.patch` and dated the day it was cut. Never keep an ad-hoc descriptive slug once the Drupal.org issue and MR numbers are known — that form is only for a fix with no upstream issue/MR to cite. The `extra.patches` key quotes the upstream issue the same way on every branch (`"Issue #3507495: <full upstream title>"`), so one patch reads identically everywhere.
